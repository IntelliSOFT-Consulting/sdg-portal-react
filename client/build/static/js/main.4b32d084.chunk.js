We considered each of the 232 SDG indicators (IAEG-SDGs, 2016) proposed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators and endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission, and included those that met five criteria. Some official SDG indicators met the five criteria but could not be included as they did not permit a ranking of countries or the definition of a quantitative threshold signifying achievement of the goals applicable to all countries. For example, different countries specialize in different sectors of the economy, so there is no \u201cright\u201d threshold of manufacturing as a share of GDP for which all countries should aim. While individual countries may find the share of manufacturing value added highly useful for developing long-term strategies for industrialization, it is not possible to define a common threshold for the SDGs. Other official SDG indicators are similarly useful at the country level but cannot serve as a yardstick for comparing countries\u2019 performance internationally. Where official SDG indicators did not meet the criteria for data selection or where indicator gaps remained, we considered official and other metrics published in peer-reviewed literature, as well as major databases and reports on development and environmental indicators.
